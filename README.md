# CleverBell - workout journal

CleverBell was created as NodeJS / MongoDB demo project. It utilizes EJS templates and Chartist bar chart.

This is not the finished version of the app but it is somewhat usable. You can see it in action at https://cleverbell.herokuapp.com .

CleverBell has a simple user register / login form. A registered user can log their excercises and see a bar chart showing user's latest activity in minutes. The exsisting excercises (or activities) can be edited and deleted. User is also able to delete their account.
